Restaurant App

This app is focused on presenting the restaurants' offer and also it was a project made completely with React JS.
Main goal for this project was implementing and fetching API. I had some challenges in completing this task as I had one API for categories and had to figure about how to implement the second one based on the category name, since all the data wasn't with the categories API. In the end it was solved by implementing key in a form of variable to the second API to fetch the data successfully. 

Technologies used were, as previously mentioned fetch API and ReactJS, hooks (useState, useEffect), custom CSS3, HTML5.

This project has taught me how to implement API into the page, how to use  hooks in react and also some things about CSS like how to show modal component look good on click and better understanding of how to setup NavBar.

All in all I am proud of this project because it was the most challenging one so far.
